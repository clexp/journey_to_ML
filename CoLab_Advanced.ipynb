We do this in case there are any files already uploaded to this session, as if there are any duplicates, a new copy will be created, rather than the file being overwritten.  The `%` symbol indicates it is something known in Python as a *Magic Command* (the `!` symbol is also a sign of a Magic Command, but using a temporary subshell).  Don't worry too much about this at the moment - just know that you typically need to use these Magic Commands when you want to issue filesystem commands outside of your Python code.  Think of it as telling the iPython console to take a step outside and do something before coming back in.  The filesystem command we use here is `rm` - the Unix *remove* command (the servers are Unix-based).  `-r` means do this \"recursively\" - ie also remove everything in any folders you find, and any folders you find within those folders too etc.  `*` means \"everything\".  So this command basically says \"Step outside a moment, and delete all files from this directory and all sub-folders\".  IMPORTANT - DON'T GO WAVING AROUND COMMANDS LIKE `%rm -r *` OUTSIDE OF COLAB IF YOU'RE USING A UNIX-BASED OS (LINUX, MACOS) AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO A LOCAL RUNTIME (YOU WON'T BE BY DEFAULT).

        "5. Then we'll use another Magic Command `%ls` which calls the Unix *List* command (Unix's equivalent of `dir` for any old DOS users...).  This command just says \"give me a list of every file in the current directory\".\n",
