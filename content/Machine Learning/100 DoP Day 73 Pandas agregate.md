## This was...
This Wednesday, 73 of 100 days of python. This was an introduction to the aggregate function. We were looking at data from the Lego data sets.
## I already knew...
A fair amount of this was new to me, although now I was somewhat familiar with the python, Jupiter notebooks.

## What was new...
This stretched my familiarity with the count function, the group by function, and also the aggregate function. Just looking at the arrangement of words in the python code does not tell me immediately what it is doing. The opportunity to experiment was helpful and instructive.

It was also interesting to see some of the data about the Lego sets. It was instructive to see that Lego is not as old as I thought it was and at what time frame in history, Lego has had a surge in the number of sets available.
## I particularly liked... 
It was fascinating to see which sets were the oldest, which sets at the most number of parts and how the complexity of sets has increased over time.

These chapters have been really fun to work with real-world data.
