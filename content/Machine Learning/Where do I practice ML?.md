I want to learn how to do machine learning. The more I examine this, clearly the bigger field it becomes. This is not like teaching oneself watercolour. This is a large and rapidly growing and also changing field.

One thing that has been helpful is the podcasts. In the words of Graham Alcott, writer of the book "productivity ninja ", podcasts are today's information DJs. That is to say radio DJs filter and select great music. This saves you the time. With V plethora of information available, you need someone to DJ or highlight and select useful information. Podcasts do this.

Podcasts are often part of a community.

This is a word that has come up again and again in discussions about success of open source projects. The python community is large and supportive.

The Rust community is accepting and welcoming.

If I am listening to a podcast, then I have a foot in a community. (Maybe a toe.)

If you listen to the podcasts enough, then you get drawn into the community and may even attend meet ups. When you are in community you get support and advice and so a community can support you to learn. The main sites are cargo and hugging face. And there are some good podcasts, such as practical, AI and TWIML.
