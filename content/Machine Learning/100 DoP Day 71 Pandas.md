## This was...

This was a review of day 71 on the hundred days of python course through Udemy. This was a review of how to use panders from earlier lectures and chapters. We covered the basics of loading some data and exploring it with the pedestals.

## I already knew...

This was simply revision. There was very little new here. It is a little tricky becoming familiar with the pandas syntax.

## What was new...

The Anders syntax can be a little tricky. It is not always clear with Meyer. I should use the object model or whether I should use the dictionary model.

Since the data frame is an object, there are lots of powerful features to use.

## I particularly liked...

In this lecture, we covered a range of college majors and their subsequent earning potential. It was not a surprise that computer engineering was one of the better paid salaries. At 43, it does make me consider my life choices. While I am paid very well I can't help feeling like there are other good options.

This also affected how I feel about my children's future. They are open to choose whatever they want to do, but I can't help but want to nudge them in a direction.
