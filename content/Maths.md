I just wanted to take a note about maths.

I love maths. It's really great. There's always only two outcomes, you're either right or you're wrong. It's so much better than everything else in life.

Most things in life you're probably right. Oh you're probably wrong. Or it's not clear. And for a lot of these things it's never clear. You actually have to live with uncertainty. Living with uncertainty is difficult. Don't I know that as a medical doctor.

I like certainty. I know right now in the Sun will rise, there will be food on the table. I don't like uncertainty will I in front end up in front of the GMC? Nobody likes uncertainty telling someone that they're definitely gonna die in the next three months, till even thank me, telling me that I don't know whether they're going to have a shortened life or not. That provides a lot of anxiety.

But maths is great. Maths is really good. You are either right, or you are wrong, there's no uncertainty.
