## This was...
Again a nice clear voyage with worked examples with quizzes that really stimulate engagement.  There are papers made from a selection of past paper questions at the end.  While this info is available online, it has been ideally curated to help you grasp the material, with a teachers experience to context.  

## I already knew...
Almost all of the material, but it was helpful to work through examples of where in the world the maths does and also does not apply.  

The Product moment correlation coefficient was not new.  I have not use it since A levels 25 years ago.  
## What was new...
I do not recall hypothesis generation.  I probably did do this but it was very peripheral to the maths I did.  

Reading papers in medicine, there have been lots of analyses that I have had to just accept.  

This talked through assessing a correlation on population samples, and the appropriateness or suitability of using a PMCC r value to draw a conclusion about a set of data.  This was the maths behind the phrase "correlation does not mean causation".  

We watched repeatedly generated random dataset from which a sample was drawn.  The sample had PMCC calculated, and in some instances, the PMCC was high, suggesting correlation, where the orginal data had no such correlation.  This was revealing that Maths must be applied appropriately.  

We went on to see what happens when we increase the sample size.  The PMCC begins to close in on the actual PMCC for the sample.  This means higher sample size is more likely reflection the population.  

The question this generates is: What sample size is sufficient to make a false correlation unlikely? To answer that you need to know what probability of error you are happy with.  There are tables for this, and you look up what is called the 'significance', and calculate against this.  
## I particularly liked... 

Woody's pleasure in talking through the maths is charming and adoptable, meaning I took it on.  This meant I enjoyed doing the quizzes and the papers at the end
