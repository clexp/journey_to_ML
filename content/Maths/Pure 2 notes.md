### Partial Fractions
How do we find $A$ and $B$?
$$\frac{3x+4}{(x-2)(x+3)}\equiv\frac{A}{x-2}+\frac{B}{x+3}$$
$$\frac{3x+4}{(x-2)(x+3)}\equiv\frac{A(x+3)}{(x-2)(x+3)}+\frac{B(x-2)}{(x-2)(x+3)}$$
$$\frac{3x+4}{(x-2)(x+3)}\equiv\frac{A(x+3)+B(x-2)}{(x-2)(x+3)}$$
$$3x+4\equiv A(x+3)+B(x-2)$$
$$3x+4\equiv Ax+3A+Bx-2B$$
$$3x+4\equiv Ax+3A+Bx-2B$$
$$3x\equiv Ax+Bx;  4\equiv 3A-2B$$
$$3-B\equiv A;  4\equiv 3A-2B$$
$$4=3(3-B)-2B; 4=9-5B; B=1, A=2$$

### Proof

### Functions and Graphs

### Sequences and Series

### Binomial expansion

### Radians
Radians and degrees are like celcius and fahrenheit.  A Radian is about 57 degrees, but this is not the definition you should use.  The definition you should use is 180 degrees is $\pi$ radian.  This is good, because an arc length is $r\theta$ where $r$ is the radius and $\theta$ is the arc angle in radians.  

### Trigonometric Functions
$$\tan x=\frac{1}{adj}$$
$$\cot x = \frac{1}{tan x} = \frac{cos x}{sin x}$$
The 'secant' is the full name of the $\sec x$ 
$$\sec x= \frac{1}{\cos x}$$
The 'cosecant' is the full name of the $\csc x$.

$$\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$$
Prooving identities:

##### Pythagorean identities:
$$\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta =1$$
$$\tan^2\theta+1=\sec^2\theta$$
$$1+cot^2\theta=\csc^2\theta$$
##### Prooving Identities
Prove that
$$\sec^2 A-\sin^2 A \equiv \tan^2 A+\cos^2 A$$
We can use the pythagorean identity
$$\tan^2 x +1 \equiv \sec^2 x$$
to reach
$$\equiv \tan^2 A +1 -\sin^2A$$
And another pythagorean identity
$$\sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1;\sin^2 x = 1- \cos^2 x$$
to get

$$\equiv \tan^2 A + 1 -(1-\cos^2 A)$$
simplifying to the answer:
$$\equiv \tan^2 A - \cos^2 A$$



### Parametric equations
This is where both x and y are outputs, and there is a separate variable (usually t), on which they are based.  Compare this to the cartesian equation, where x is the input and y is the output.  

_Why?_
Because of what they do for you.  You can draw much more complicated shapes, much more simply.  

##### Differentiation
If you can differentiate these expression, again that opens up a doorway
