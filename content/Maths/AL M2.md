Summary: UK A Level Maths review, Mechanics Maths 2

## This was...
This was the mechanics to a level year two course by Woody Lowenstein on you do me.
## I already knew...
As a mechanical engineer, very little is new here. My goal is to learn machine learning and artificial intelligence and at time of writing I have chosen not to pursue this particular video series. I did complete the mechanics one series and felt it added nothing to the knowledge required for machine learning. With a tight time, I will park the mechanics two for another time.
## What was new...
I can't comment here.
## I particularly liked... 
I cannot comment here, however, if this is like any of Woodies other videos, the delivery style and pattern of short lecture, followed by exercise is excellent and 2nd to none.
