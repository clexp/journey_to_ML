## This was...
This was the statistics, one or year, one A-level or AS maths on Udemy by Woody Lowenstein.
## I already knew...
While I have done A-level maths previously, my statistical maths was somewhat watered-down at the time. Since then I have done almost no statistical maths during my engineering degree. During medicine, there were nominal approaches to medical statistics, but even with my mathematical ability being better than my peers, this was mostly wasted on me.

This was a great opening, introduction to understanding and appreciating data sets.
## What was new...
These days the A-levels seem to provide you with data sets. When you are in the exam you are expected to have familiarity with a dataset that you have been presented with in the months previously to the exam. This means you need to have familiarity with the missing data. Tobias is the averages and the standard deviations. While you do not need to recall any numerical facts out right, it helps to have a feel for the dataset.

I thought this was great.

Woody prevent presents you with data sets from no less than four examining boards.

He takes some time to walk through the key features of which you should be aware. At the time of completing this, I felt I would really go and complete the A-level exam.

This is unnecessary on a pathway to learn machine learning.

This was a great basic introduction to the simple tools for analysing data set.
## I particularly liked... 
As always, the delivery style was excellent. Further the pattern of short video followed by exercises really stimulated drawing as much as you could from the course. The examination samples were good and the examples worked. Examples were excellent.
