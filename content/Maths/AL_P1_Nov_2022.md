Summary: Going back to high school maths a quarter century later
I recall liking maths at secondary school. 

I was a middle set candidate. My school did maths one year early. It is hard to get the higher grades on the middle tier papers. And as a middle middle tier candidate I was set for the middle tier papers.

To my surprise and everyone else's I did get the top mark. I was put in to a very high A-level set. My age appears at other schools were still doing the ordinary level paper. But this was too much.

At a level. this was my one a grade. My brother and sister both did double A-level maths. I am a mathematician from a mathematics family. The maths

The maths at university was difficult but I managed it. We stepped well beyond the limits of single maths.

During actual work at engineering the maths used was relatively light compared to degree level. That even includes live thermodynamic calculations of functioning chemical plants.

The maths on the medicine course was very light statistics. There was very little use of the A-level and degree level maths I had learned in engineering. In one situation, a medical statistician had provided a colleague with lots of complex statistics. I felt this was unfair as it was clearly impenetrable to most medical doctors. Deep statistical maths is really not a diagnostic tool, it is more appropriate in a research and public health setting. Clinical practice. Certainly did not use much maths at all.

Machine learning is clearly based on quite a lot of fairly complex maths. I am keen and willing to dive into this, but as I am doing so there are plenty of unknowns to me. With that in mind, I found a Udemy refresher, A-level maths course.

I would like to thank Louis I would like to thank Woody Lowenstein for his excellent Udemy A-level maths course. The pure one course was brilliant and here are a few highlights.
