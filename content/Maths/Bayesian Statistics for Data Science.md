### What is this
This is a five hour Udemy course on Bayesian maths as it applies to statistics for machine learning. I picked this out because I was developing growing interest in what statistics is.

I have been listening to a number of podcasts wearing Basin statistics had surfaced as a topic. This included one of my favourites super data science.

Based on statistics is clearly a type of math that has been present for a long time. It appears in recent years it has been planted by what is called frequent statistics. All of my statistical education was for frequent statistics and basing statistics was entirely unknown to me. It appears Bayesian statistics presume nothing about the known or unknown variable being investigate.

There are plenty of resources out there and I have purchased more than one. This one felt pretty good for high school and beyond. There were some nice mini quizzes and even a micro challenge paper to download for extra practice. I thought these were quite good.
### What did I learn
I learned a great deal from this. I got some good practice with exercising simple bass and maths. I felt this provided a good grounding for other investigative work.

I learnt about uniform distributions and continuous prayers, and I learn about the beat by no family of distributions and why this is important.

I also learn about the price on distribution that normal distribution and more advanced models and how they apply to bayesian statistics.

#### An expression can be a function or formula
The Asian law is useful for calculating single probabilities. In the learning examples this usually involves single point cases. However, for any given variable in the function that variable may have its own full function, meaning that its probability can vary. This is the strength of the Bayesian analysis, you can use it to calculate a range of probabilities. 

Beta Binomial distributions are useful for a lot of things, but they are not useful for multi peak or multi modal data.  

#### Priors and posteriors
The prior is the probability based on a little bit of initial assumption. This is combined with the likelihood function to calculate what is called the posterior. The posterior is a representation of the calculated likelihood is based on the knowledge and data observed. The posterior is thought to be a more accurate representative of the theory based on the data.

The Priors and posteriors are best expressed as a distribution which falls between zero and one. Usually these are called conjugates, which means that a prior and a posterior are expressed in a similar fashion. The value of this is that the posterior can become the prior of the next round of evaluation based on more data. This allows our calculations to gradually refine to more accurate models.

Bernoulli and Binomial form:

$$ \theta^{k} (1-\theta)^{1-k} $$

We are usually using distributions called benoli  distributions or beta binomial distributions. The beta binomial distribution is the conjugate of itself and also of the benoulli distribution.

Conjugate Prior of the Beta distribution:
$$ \theta^{\alpha-1} (1-\theta)^{\beta-1} $$

Poisson Distribution
$$ P(X=k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!} $$
Gamma distribution
$$ \pi(\lambda) = \frac{}{}\lambda^{\alpha-1}e^{-\beta\theta}, \theta > 0 $$
The gamma distribution is the conjugate prior of the Poisson distribution
#### Credible Intervals
Once we have our bass on a posterior, we are looking at a curve on a graph. This is similar to a normal distribution, but not the same. It is helpful to be able to state an interval between Norton one where lies 90% or 95% of the likelihood. This is usually done numerically by calculating the cumulative distribution function. This is done twice and both numbers are used to calculate the range in the distribution.

Credible intervals look the same, but not the same as confidence intervals from frequentis statistics.
### Do I recommend?

Overall, this was a good course and sufficiently long for the value purchase price. I would recommend this as a good place to start. You do need to have a good quality of high school maths that is relatively current. I'm an engineer so I am mathematically experienced and more recently repeated some A-level maths modules also through Udemy.

I did find that the discussion about distributions with relation to
