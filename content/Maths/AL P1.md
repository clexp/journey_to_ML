## This was...
This was the Udemy A-level maths PE course for year one or a S level by Woody Lowenstein.


## I already knew...
I have completed A-level maths before. That was when I was 18 and at time of writing this I am 43, so 25 years ago. Since then I've used substantial maths on my engineering degree, much less maths as an engineering practitioner and almost no maths in my medicine career.

None of the material is new to me, but this was completely a refresher. I worked through all of the questions and all of the past papers.
## What was new...
Some of the methods were new to me, and clearly were the starting grounds for some of the higher concepts. You need today in machine learning. There was some useful information about binomial expansion is some new material on trigonometry and a good introduction to vectors.

## I particularly liked... 
I particularly liked the material covering natural log and logarithm graphs. While this was not knew it was covered very well. I would very strongly commend this course. Woodys style is clear and engaging, and also to the point. The short model of a little lecture, followed by a little practice was great at reinforcing the material. I think it is 2nd to none.
