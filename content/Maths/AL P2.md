## This was...
This was pure to year two of the A-level maths on Udemy by Woody Lowenstein

## I already knew...
I have covered a level maths before and so I knew a good deal of this. The maths I did previously was a little thin, having covered smaller levels of pure maths. This particular chapter was enormous. It covered huge amounts of differentiation and integration.

There was substantial commitment behind achieving this. We covered huge areas.

You should see the link above. There were a substantial number of areas all of which were covered to substantial depth. While I knew some differentiation and integration, the depth that was substantial. The chapter also covered a significant amount of trigonometry.
## What was new...
The differentiation covered a number of tools for performing differentials of complex functions. Equally, the integration chapter covered, a large number of tools for integrating complex functions and overlapped substantially with trigonometry and binomial expansion. It took quite some time to cover this. The integration chapter alone is four hours.

There is a chapter on parametric equations. I do not recall this at all from A-level maths in 1998.

It is however clear that this is part of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This was a nice opening introduction. There was also a section on three-dimensional vectors. This was an extension on two-dimensional vectors from year one.
## I particularly liked...

I particularly liked how the different chapter areas overlapped.

Woody has chosen wisely in the order of material and how it is presented. The strength again was the short video followed by the short exercise to reinforce it. This was a great course and I cannot recommend it enough.
