## This was...

This is an introduction to graph theory from the basics. It was nice to have a walk-through what is a graph with simple basic rules, and exercises at the end of each section. My brother advised I read this book with a notebook in hand, and so I did. He was right during things graphically made things much easier to understand. I didn't do all of the exercises but I did do some.

## I already knew...

I knew that graphs were made of nodes and edges and can be in two or three dimensional space however this is not a feature of recording graphs. Computer computers often will not have any dimensional representation of graphs besides a list of notes and edges. This was not a very long book, but it did take some time to get through it.

## What was new...

The book was very revealing and gave me some great solutions to some programming problems when I worked through the Python track on the exorcism website. I am beginning to see how graph theory provides a solution to a number of problems, both in the physical world and with data handling. I have listened to some podcasts about graph databases, and knowledge graphs.

## I particularly liked...

I particularly liked the exercise exercises that you could do to form and build your understanding.
