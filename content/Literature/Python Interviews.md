## This was...

The Python community is huge and there are key luminaries in it. Michael Driscoll made an exercise of interviewing a dozen also key Python figures and including the interviews in a book. Being an outsider to the community this gave me a great insight into who the players are what they're interests are and what Python can do in its entirety.

It also gave me some great insight about where people feel Python is going to go, and some history about where Python has come from and the difficulty with the change from Python 2 to Python three.

## I already knew...

I actually knew very little about the Python community at large.

## What was new...

I learned a little bit about the backstory behind all of the characters leading the Python world. Some of them were a little bit like me and some really weren't this was both encouraging and also mind opening. I learned that everyone can contribute, and when everyone does, we are all the better.

## I particularly liked...

Asking these key figures about their personal interests and what they like and where they want to go was really interesting. There are some great players with some great ideas and great ability to outwork them. I feel that Python has a great future and I'm really pleased that I read this book.
