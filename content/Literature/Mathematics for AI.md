## This was...

This book was a few years in the making and it was released in stages. It covers the maths to some depth and the author explains key points.

## I already knew...

I was already familiar with some of the basic linear algebra, and also some of the calculus. This material was denser and harder to go through. I didn't complete the whole book, but then I haven't had all of the chapters yet.

## What was new...

I was not familiar with some of the probability theory, but machine learning is Glorified statistics and Inference might be better described as statistical guessing.

## I particularly liked...

At some point you have to dive into the depths and this was deep.
