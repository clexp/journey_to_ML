    <p>This is like maths. A lot of people say it's not like maths in that it is language. It is a language but it's also like maths.</p>
<p>Languages are vague. Lots of meanings of different uses for different people. Two people speaking, the same language can mean different things. But with programming languages, it's explicit. There is no opportunity for ambiguity, in natural language it is inevitable, and even deliberately used as normal practice.</p>
<p>Humans are linguists.  We think in language, we write in language, we communicate in language. We are language machine. Humans also like there to be a clear difference between true and false. Perhaps that's the real reason reason we made computers binary.</p>
<p>But the real world doesn't give us a difference between true and false.</p>
<p>Programming does.</p>
<p>Programming is like language that we might use all the time. But programming is like maths, either work or they don't, there's only two outcomes. It's the perfect union of what I'm built for, language, but also what I like - certainty. Either you're certainly right, or you're certainly wrong. Only two outcomes. Thank you programming.</p>
