    <p>I just wanted to take a note about maths.</p>
<p>I love maths. It's really great. There's always only two outcomes, you're either right or you're wrong. It's so much better than everything else in life.</p>
<p>Most things in life you're probably right. Oh you're probably wrong. Or it's not clear. And for a lot of these things it's never clear. You actually have to live with uncertainty. Living with uncertainty is difficult. Don't I know that as a medical doctor.</p>
<p>I like certainty. I know right now in the Sun will rise, there will be food on the table. I don't like uncertainty will I in front end up in front of the GMC? Nobody likes uncertainty telling someone that they're definitely gonna die in the next three months, till even thank me, telling me that I don't know whether they're going to have a shortened life or not. That provides a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p>But maths is great. Maths is really good. You are either right, or you are wrong, there's no uncertainty.</p>
