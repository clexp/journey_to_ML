# Web blog for learning maths programming and machine learning

This is a demonstration of learning Python, web development, maths statistics and machine learning.

If you notice some of the books and reading goes back for more than 20 years. I'm not jumping on this bandwagon because it's a FAD. I have long-standing interest in this.

Going on this journey require substantial learning and demonstrating this. Dis log is the plot apart for others that are coming on the same journey.

It starts with a voyage into maths and basic programming in order to then explore data science. Let's be clear: data science is, in the end, science. And maths with programming provides anyone who can weild them, with a superpower. This is a road, many people will want to go down.
